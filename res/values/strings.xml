    <string name="howto">The point of the game is to survive all the waves of enemies that come. To defend yourself, you have to build towers. To build towers press and hold your finger at the desired location. This brings up the tower menu, which shows the different towers you can buy. Towers you have enough money to buy will be shown with color. If you don’t have enough the tower will be grayed out. Each wave consists of a group of mobs that you are to kill. If a mob gets through your defenses, you will lose one life. In total you have %1$d lives, and if this amount depletes, you have lost the game. To move around the map you can hold a location and drag it away from where you want to go. To zoom in or out, you can use pinch zoom with two fingers.</string>
