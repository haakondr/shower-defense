All in all, the project has not encountered many major problems. The architecture was changed quite a bit, but no major changes were made to the architectural tactics. The main reason for changing the architecture is mostly related to the framework used (Sheep). In retrospect, we could have researched how Sheep is organized better, before planning the architecture.

Even though changes were made, they were small, and caused few problems.
