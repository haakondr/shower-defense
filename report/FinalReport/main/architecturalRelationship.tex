The main inconsistence between the architecture and the implementation is the testability. We had planned for the game to be much easier to test that it ended up with. This is because it is a lot harder to do testing of a graphical user interface in a game than we expected, and we did not foresee this problem before we started. It is also hard to do testing in a multi-threaded environment. This could perhaps have been discovered in the ATAM evaluation, but neither our group or the other group made any comments about it. In the end we found out that the most convenient way to debug the system was by logging during runtime. The Logcat utility provided with the Android SDK was also a great tool for debugging.
