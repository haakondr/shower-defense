\label{stakeholders}

Course staff - the concerns of the course staff would be how easy it is to
compile-and-run the final product, and how good the documentation of the code
is. These are concerns for them because they will evaluate our product according
to these criteria.

Android users - this stakeholder is an android user who wants to try
to play the game. One of the concerns for this stakeholder is how easy the game is to run and
play. This means that the instructions on how to play the game should be easily
available and easy to understand. The stakeholder is also concerned with how good the usability for the game is. That is, how easy the game is to get familiar with and the sense of control it provides.

Programmers - the programmers concerns are mainly with the implementation of the system. They want the architecture to be in such a way that further implementation and improvement is as easy to perform as possible. This can be achieved by using patterns in the implementation. Good documentation of the code is also a valid concern of the programmers.

\newline
Testers - good testability is the main concern for the testers. They want the system to be as easy to test as possible, to ensure that all features can be checked properly. Good testability will result in less work for the testers, and thus, lower costs.
