This report will give an overview over the chosen architectures of the Action Hero Defense game, developed as a part of the TDT4240 course assignment.
We will focus on the reasons behind our choices of architecture, in addition to discussing how the chosen architecture conforms to the quality requirements which are set. Primarily the modifiability and testability quality requirements.

In the first section of this report, we will give an introduction on the architectural drivers of the game. This section will describe how the both the functional and quality requirements influence our choice of architecture. 

The next section, the architectural views, will offer a description of the architecture from different perspectives, or \emph{views}. Here we focus on two perspectives which we feel is most relevant for our project; the logical and the development view.

The Tactics-section will focus on the various techniques and methods we will employ to obtain the desired quality requirements, such as the modifiability 


Finally, we will discuss the design and architectural patterns we wish to implement in our system. We have decided on the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern and we will discuss how this pattern fits in to our selected quality requirements.
