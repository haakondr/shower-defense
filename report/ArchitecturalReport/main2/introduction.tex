This report will give an overview over the chosen architecture for Warcraft Tower Defense, developed as an assignment in the course TDT4240, Software Architecture.
In this report we will focus on the reasons behind our choices of architecture, in addition to discussing how the chosen architecture conforms to the quality requirements -- modifiablity and testability. 

In the first section of this report, we will give an introduction on the architectural drivers of the game. This section will describe how the functional- and quality requirements, in addition to the business and technical constraints, influence our choice of architecture. 

The next section, the architectural views, will offer a description of the architecture from different perspectives, or \emph{views}. Here we focus on two perspectives which we feel are the most relevant for our project; the logical and the development view.

The Tactics-section will focus on the various techniques and methods we will employ to obtain the desired quality requirements, such as the modifiability.


Finally, we will discuss the design and architectural patterns we wish to implement in our system and why.
